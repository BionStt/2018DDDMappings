# 2018DDDMappings
Demos and slides from May 2018 Mapping DDD Domains with EF Core 2.1

In my presentation I opened a number of branches each implementing the next mapping I discussed. The final branch was for shadow properties but it contains all of the previous mappings, code and tests. That's what this repository contains along with a PDF of the slides. The last slide has a number of links to learn more.
